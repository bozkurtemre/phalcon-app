# Phalcon Application

[Phalcon][1] is a web framework delivered as a C extension providing high
performance and lower resource consumption.

This is a sample application for the Phalcon PHP Framework. We expect to
implement as many features as possible to showcase the framework and its
potential.

Please write us if you have any feedback.

Thanks.
